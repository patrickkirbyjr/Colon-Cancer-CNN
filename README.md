\# Detecting Colon Cancer Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)



\### Notebook Overview

Goal: Build a deep learning model using a Convolutional Neural Netowrk (CNN) to classify histopathological images of colon tissue as cancerous or non-cancerous.



Dataset: \[Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images)



Output: A trained CNN model capable of accurately predicting new histopathologiical images as cancerous or non-cancerous.



Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
